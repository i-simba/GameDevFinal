## This repository contains files in my assets folder for my GameDev final, Outbreak

A working build and more information can be found in my [itch.io page](https://isimba.itch.io/outbreak)

## About the game
The game I created is called 'Outbreak' and it's a top down zombie shooter.
The zombies spawn in endless waves, and the objective is for the player to survive as long as possible.
After each wave, the player is able to purchase better guns, gun upgrades, or player upgrades.

## What I learned
I learned how to properly structure a project in Unity, and utilize the many concepts we learned in class,
to include, basic scripting in c#, interfaces, AI basics, and gameplay loops.

## What I could have improved
Due to the limited time available to work on the project, while also learning game development for the first time,
I ran into a few issues during development.
The major issue I ran into was keeping my project organized and implement a better design pattern.
A lot of my classes were dependent on each other, and changing something in one class can have effects on
multiple classes.
I also could have utilized Unity's delegates and events more.

## Moving forward
I plan on creating more games in the future to get better at coding.
And although this development was stressful, it was fun and I learned a lot.
Better project organization by implementing the observer pattern, and utilizng
Unity delegates and events more will definitely be an area I will be focusing on.
